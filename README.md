# CommercePulse: Predictive Customer Analytics Dashboard

An interactive web-based presentation showcasing a complete data science project focused on predicting customer spending and churn for an e-commerce dataset.


## 🚀 Project Overview

CommercePulse is an interactive web dashboard that walks through a customer analytics project from start to finish. Instead of a static slideshow, this project uses a live web interface to present the data processing steps, model training, and final evaluation. The primary goals of the analysis are:

1.  **Regression:** To predict a customer's total spending (`Monetary` value).
2.  **Classification:** To predict whether a customer is likely to churn.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Walkthrough:** A step-by-step presentation format guiding the user through the data science workflow.
- **Model Comparison:** Side-by-side evaluation of multiple regression and classification models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM).
- **Rich Visualizations:** Dynamic charts, plots, and tables to illustrate data and model performance.
- **Modern UI:** A clean, responsive interface with a toggleable light/dark theme, designed for a professional presentation experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
-   **Backend Analysis (Pre-computed):** The charts and metrics displayed were generated using a Python data analysis pipeline (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn).

##  How to View
